@BOOK{Bradski2008,
  title = {Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library},
  publisher = {O'Reilly Media, Incorporated},
  year = {2008},
  author = {Gary Bradski and Adrian Kaehler},
  month = sep,
  abstract = {"This library is useful for practitioners, and is an excellent tool
	for those entering the field: it is a set of computer vision algorithms
	that work as advertised." -William T. Freeman, Computer Science and
	Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
	Learning OpenCV puts you in the middle of the rapidly expanding field
	of computer vision. Written by the creators of the free open source
	OpenCV library, this book introduces you to computer vision and demonstrates
	how you can quickly build applications that enable computers to "see"
	and make decisions based on that data. Computer vision is everywhere-in
	security systems, manufacturing inspection systems, medical image
	analysis, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and more. It stitches Google
	maps and Google Earth together, checks the pixels on LCD screens,
	and makes sure the stitches in your shirt are sewn properly. OpenCV
	provides an easy-to-use computer vision framework and a comprehensive
	library with more than 500 functions that can run vision code in
	real time. Learning OpenCV will teach any developer or hobbyist to
	use the framework quickly with the help of hands-on exercises in
	each chapter. This book includes: A thorough introduction to OpenCV
	Getting input from cameras Transforming images Segmenting images
	and shape matching Pattern recognition, including face detection
	Tracking and motion in 2 and 3 dimensions 3D reconstruction from
	stereo vision Machine learning algorithms Getting machines to see
	is a challenging but entertaining goal. Whether you want to build
	simple or sophisticated vision applications, Learning OpenCV is the
	book you need to get started.},

  title = {Calibrating a multi-arm multi-sensor robot: A Bundle Adjustment Approach},
  booktitle = {International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER)},
  year = {2010},
  address = {New Delhi, India},
  month = {12/2010},
  abstract = {<p>Complex robots with multiple arms and sensors need good calibration
	to perform precise tasks in unstructured environments. The sensors
	must be calibrated both to the manipulators and to each other, since
	fused sensor data is often needed. We propose an extendable framework
	that combines measurements from the robot{\textquoteright}s various
	sensors (proprioceptive and external) to calibrate the robot{\textquoteright}s
	joint offsets and external sensor locations. Our approach is unique
	in that it accounts for sensor measurement uncertainties, thereby
	allowing sensors with very different error characteristics to be
	used side by side in the calibration. The framework is general enough
	to handle complex robots with kinematic components, including external
	sensors on kinematic chains. We validate the framework by implementing
	it on the Willow Garage PR2 robot, providing a significant improvement
	in the robot{\textquoteright}s calibration.</p>},
